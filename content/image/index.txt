<strong style="font-size:18px">Welcome to Liberty Bible College & Seminary</strong><br /><br /><br />
     

Liberty Bible College & Seminary (LBCS) is a Bible-believing institution which accepts the following declarations as being taught in Scripture. Thus, they are accepted by us and authoritatively reliable.<br /><br /><br />


The inspiration and authority of Scripture
One God, subsisting in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
The creation of the human race in the image of God
The fall of man and resultant human depravity
The deity of Christ, His incarnation, atoning death, and bodily resurrection
Salvation by the grace of God alone through faith to Jesus Christ alone
Only holy Christian church, the Body of Christ
The second coming of Jesus Christ and the consummation of all things<br /><br /><br />


We affirm the authority of the Bible and believe in the integration of faith, learning, and ministry. We endorse the practice of distance education as a significant contributor to the educational needs of the religious and global community.
